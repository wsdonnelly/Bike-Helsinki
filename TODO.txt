DONE
-->Refactor SurfaceTypes as bits eg. more versitile in the long run, perhaps make some typedef or const like using bitWidth = uint16_t;
    enum SurfaceTypes : bitWidth
    {
        SURF_PAVED = 1 << 0,

DONE
-->In bindings/route.cpp
    Add new function 'BuildFilteredGraph' that can be called from the frontend on controls state change
    Add backend endpoint

DONE
-->Add control features to frontend
    should probably be triggered on controls window close, not every selection
    main map window should have side bar (or something) that always shows the selection

---------------------------------------------------OPEN-----------------------------------------------------------------

-->Filtering graph creates disconnected networks. add 'walkable' segments to connect graphs.
    display with dotted line
    tags:
        bicycle	no
        footway	sidewalk
        highway	footway
        etc
    no need to get surface types

-->Disply graphlines, (either in debug mode or normal) colored by surface type.
    Allow hover or click on polyline to display information

-->Display all graphlines (like current debug mode) for current zoom level and current filtered graph in color with button
    is too big for browser?
    maybe limit display to single surafce types on master branch


-->Investigate if its needed to build initial kd-tree blob.
    Now snap to graph, builds kd_tree on demand based on current filtered graph

-->Refactor hardcoded paths

-->Investigate optimizing the graph.
    Make directed graph? prune redundant edges etc?? reduce memory consumption.

-->Investigate simplyfying surface types in UI. maybe could just be: dedicated bike path (paved), trail etc

-->Improve tag reading in injest
    eg. add Tag:highway=path to bikable graph
