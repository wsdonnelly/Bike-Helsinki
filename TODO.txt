DONE
-->Refactor SurfaceTypes as bits eg. more versitile in the long run, perhaps make some typedef or const like using bitWidth = uint16_t;
    enum SurfaceTypes : bitWidth
    {
        SURF_PAVED = 1 << 0,

DONE
-->In bindings/route.cpp
    Add new function 'BuildFilteredGraph' that can be called from the frontend on controls state change
    Add backend endpoint

-->Refactor hardcoded paths

-->Add control features to frontend
    should probably be triggered on controls window close, not every selection
    main map window should have side bar (or something) that always shows the selection

-->Investigate optimizing the graph.
    Make directed graph? prune redundant edges etc?? reduce memory consumption.
