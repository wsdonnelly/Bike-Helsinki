DONE
-->Refactor SurfaceTypes as bits eg. more versitile in the long run, perhaps make some typedef or const like using bitWidth = uint16_t;
    enum SurfaceTypes : bitWidth
    {
        SURF_PAVED = 1 << 0,

DONE
-->In bindings/route.cpp
    Add new function 'BuildFilteredGraph' that can be called from the frontend on controls state change
    Add backend endpoint

DONE
-->Add control features to frontend
    should probably be triggered on controls window close, not every selection
    main map window should have side bar (or something) that always shows the selection

---------------------------------------------------OPEN-----------------------------------------------------------------
-->Refactor hardcoded paths

-->Investigate optimizing the graph.
    Make directed graph? prune redundant edges etc?? reduce memory consumption.

-->Filtering graph creates disconnected networks. add 'walking' segments to connect graphs.
    display with dotted line

-->Disply graphlines, (either in debug mode or normal) colored by surface type.
    Allow hover or click on polyline to display information

-->Display all graphlines (like current debug mode) for current zoom level in color with button
    is too big for browser?

-->Investigate if its needed to build initial kd-tree blob.
    Now snap to graph, builds kd_tree on demand based on current filtered graph
